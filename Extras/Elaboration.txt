If you saw this and went "What the heck is this?", then this is to explain exactly what it's for.

There's certain assets that were made during the pack's development that couldn't be added in-game for one reason or another.

So as you could probably guess, this folder contains all of those assets.

Multi-layered backgrounds, Animated BGO, and stuff of the sort is located here for your needs.
